# Copy Commons
Base project to copy sources to the other projects in order to have a single place to test sources and keep zero dependencies in libraries

## Motivation
As bytemechanics libraries has the objective to create standalone and short libraries some classes are repackaged in order to have the source centralized but avoiding classpath collisions
